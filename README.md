# 🧑‍💻 Compile-Time C++ Metaprogramming Examples 🚀

Welcome to a collection of **C++ metaprogramming** examples, demonstrating powerful compile-time calculations that are evaluated at the time of compilation! 🎉

In this repository, you'll find various examples of compile-time computations, including factorials, Fibonacci numbers, powers of two, GCD calculations, prime number checks, and more. All of these computations are performed during compilation, improving runtime performance and showcasing the power of **template metaprogramming**! 💡

## ✨ Features

- **Factorial Calculation**: Computes the factorial of a number at compile time. 🧮
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Computes the N-th Fibonacci number during compilation. 🔢
- **Power of Two**: Checks if a number is a power of two. ⚡
- **Prime Check**: Determines if a number is prime at compile time. 🔍
- **GCD Calculation**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. 🔗

## 📦 Dependencies

This project uses **C++11** or later, so make sure your compiler supports it! ⚙️

- **C++ Standard**: C++11 or higher 📚
- **Compiler**: Any modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) that supports C++11 or later 🛠️
